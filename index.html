<h1>Chezburger</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Cameron Hilstad, also known as Chezburger. I am a 15 year old self taught programmer. I am still learning, and primarily focus on c++, but am learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript in order to make this website. I own a minecraft server at harlem.chezburger.me (note to self: make Minecraft page). For now, Chezburger out.</p>
